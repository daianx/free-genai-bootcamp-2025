I'll help you translate this sentence. Let's break it down into parts. First, here's the relevant vocabulary:

| Japanese | Romaji | English |
|----------|---------|----------|
| クマ | kuma | bear |
| ドア | doa | door |
| ゴミ | gomi | garbage |
| いる | iru | to be (for living things) |
| 出す | dasu | to put out/take out |

For a JLPT N5 level sentence structure, we can break this into two simpler sentences:
1. [Subject] + [location] + います
2. [Object] + を + [verb] + ましたか

Clues:
1. For the first part "Bears are at the door":
   - We need the plural form of bear (hint: Japanese doesn't typically use plural markers)
   - We need the location particle for "at the door"
   - Since bears are living things, we use いる (in polite form)

2. For the second part "did you leave the garbage out":
   - This is a question (hint: think about question particle)
   - It's in past tense
   - We need the object particle for "garbage"
   - The verb needs to be in past tense, polite form

Would you like to try forming either part of the sentence? We can work through it step by step!

| 出す | dasu | to put out/take out |

For a JLPT N5 level, we can split this into two simpler sentences:
1. [Subject] + [location particle] + [verb in polite form]
2. [Object] + [object particle] + [verb in past polite form] + [question particle]

Clues:
1. For the first part "Bears are at the door":
   - Think about which particle shows location/position
   - Remember, living things use a specific "to be" verb
   - The verb should be in polite form since you're likely speaking to someone

2. For the second part "did you leave the garbage out":
   - You'll need the particle that marks the direct object
   - The verb needs to be conjugated to show:
     * Past tense
     * Polite form
     * Question form
