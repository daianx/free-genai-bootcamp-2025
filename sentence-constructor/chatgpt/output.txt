Great! Let’s break it down and work through the transcription step by step.  

### **Vocabulary Table**  
| Japanese | Romaji | English |  
|----------|--------|---------|  
| 熊 | kuma | bear |  
| いる | iru | to be (for living things) |  
| ドア | doa | door |  
| 出す | dasu | to put out |  
| ゴミ | gomi | garbage |  
| 忘れる | wasureru | to forget |

### **Possible Sentence Structure**  
1. **"[Subject] [Location] [Verb]"** (for "Bears are at the door")  
2. **"[Object] [Verb (past tense)] [Question marker]?"** (for "Did you leave the garbage out?")  

### **Hints to Work Through It:**  
1. The subject is "bears." Check the vocabulary table for the right noun.  
2. To express location, use the word for "door" and think about the correct particle that pairs with location words.  
3. For existence, use the verb that applies to living things. Make sure it matches the subject correctly.  
4. For the second sentence, identify the correct verb for "to put out" and conjugate it into past tense.  
5. The object is "garbage." What particle marks the object of a sentence?  
6. This is a yes/no question. How do you structure a casual or polite question in Japanese?
