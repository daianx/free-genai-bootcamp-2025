Great! Let’s break it down and work through the transcription step by step.  

### **Vocabulary Table**  
| Japanese | Romaji | English |  
|----------|--------|---------|  
| 熊 | kuma | bear |  
| いる | iru | to be (for living things) |  
| ドア | doa | door |  
| 出す | dasu | to put out |  
| ゴミ | gomi | garbage |  
| 忘れる | wasureru | to forget |  
| あなた | anata | you |  

### **Possible Sentence Structure**  
1. **"[Subject] [Location] [Verb]"** (for "Bears are at the door")  
2. **"[Object] [Verb (past tense)] [Question marker]?"** (for "Did you leave the garbage out?")  

### **Hints to Work Through It:**  
1. The subject is "bears." Check the vocabulary table for the right noun.  
2. To express location, use the word for "door" and think about the correct particle that pairs with location words.  
3. For existence, use the verb that applies to living things. Make sure it matches the subject correctly.  
4. For the second sentence, identify the correct verb for "to put out" and conjugate it into past tense.  
5. The object is "garbage." What particle marks the object of a sentence?  
6. This is a yes/no question. How do you structure a casual or polite question in Japanese?

Let's break it down step by step!  

### **Vocabulary Table**  
| Japanese | Romaji | English |  
|----------|--------|---------|  
| 見る | miru | to see |  
| カラス | karasu | raven |  
| 今朝 | kesa | this morning |  
| 庭 | niwa | garden |  
| 見る | miru | to look at |  
| いる | iru | to be (for living things) |  

### **Possible Sentence Structure**  
1. **"[Subject] [Time] [Object] [Verb (past tense)]?"** (for "Did you see the raven this morning?")  
2. **"[Subject] [Object] [Verb (past progressive)]"** (for "It was looking at the garden.")  

### **Hints to Work Through It:**  
1. In the first sentence, the subject is "you." Do you need to explicitly state it, or can it be implied in Japanese?  
2. "This morning" acts as a time reference. Where does it typically go in a Japanese sentence?  
3. The action in the first sentence is completed, so you need to conjugate "to see" into past tense.  
4. For the second sentence, the subject is "it." Do you need to include a word for "it" in Japanese?  
5. The second verb is in the past progressive form. How do you express that something "was doing" something in Japanese?
